# Chart obtained by running mine-bio-as.scm while varying
# db-ratio. Note that 1.0 to 6.0 was run on a XXX while 0.5 to 0.1 was
# run on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700HQ CPU @ 2.60GHz, explaining the
# sudden change in run-time. The warnings column counts the number of
# times the empirical probability was estimated to zero (which isn't
# supposed to happen since the pattern support is above a positive
# threshold). The max-error mesures the absolute difference between
# surprisingness measure of any pattern between db-ratio 1.0 and any
# db-ratio below 1.0.
